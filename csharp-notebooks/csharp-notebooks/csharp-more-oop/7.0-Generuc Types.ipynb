    "# Generic Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic types let you work with collections like `List` and `Dictionary` in C#, where you can store any type of data. They help you avoid losing type safety by not having to use collections that only handle objects. This means you don't need to create separate collection classes for every data type you want to manage, saving time and keeping your code clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generics are flexible. For example, you can create a *MyStack* class that works with any type of object. You specify the type it will hold using a placeholder (commonly called T) when you declare it. This T then represents any type you choose when you use MyStack, like a stack for strings or integers.\n",
