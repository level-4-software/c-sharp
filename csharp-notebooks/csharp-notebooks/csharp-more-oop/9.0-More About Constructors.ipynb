    "A constructor is a special method for initializing new objects, used with both value types (like structures) and reference types (like classes). It shares its name with its class and lacks a return type. Constructors can check the validity of input parameters to ensure objects start with appropriate data. If input data fails these checks, the constructor should throw an exception to block the creation of an object with invalid data. For instance, an Alien class constructor might throw an exception if it receives negative values for coordinates, preventing the creation of an Alien in an invalid state.\n",

    "A program can avoid code repetition by making one constructor call another constructor by use of the keyword this. The this keyword is used in the constructor method signature as shown. It forms a call of another constructor in the object. In the program below the parameters to the call of one constructor are passed into a call of another, along with an additional lives value. Note that this means the actual body of the constructor is empty, because all of the work is performed by the call to the other constructor. Another way to provide default values to a constructor is to make use of optional parameters. These are described in “Optional and named parameters” in the section below."
