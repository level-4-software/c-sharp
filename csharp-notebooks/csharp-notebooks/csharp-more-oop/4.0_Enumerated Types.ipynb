    "# Enumerated Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumerated types (enums) are handy when you need a variable to only represent a specific set of values. For instance, if you're making a game and you have aliens that can be in one of three states: sleeping, attacking, or destroyed, enums help you enforce these options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using an integer where 0 represents sleeping, 1 for attacking, and 2 for destroyed (which risks accidentally setting the alien to an invalid state like 4), you use an enum. Enums make your code cleaner and safer by ensuring that the variable can only hold one of the predefined values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you might define and use such an enum for an alien's state:"
