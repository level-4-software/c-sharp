    "# Creating value types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of value types that can be created in a C# program. There are structures and enumerated types. Letâ€™s take a look at structures first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified Explanation of Structures in C#\n",
    "\n",
    "In C#, structures (structs) offer a way to store a small group of related variables, like a simple version of classes. You've already seen them in action in Program 2.1. Both structs and classes can contain methods, properties, data values, and constructors, but there are key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialization Requirement: A struct's constructor must initialize all data members. Unlike classes, structs don't allow uninitialized fields.\n",
    "- No Parameterless Constructors: You can't define a parameterless constructor in a struct. However, when you instantiate a struct without specifying any parameters, C# automatically generates a parameterless constructor that sets all fields to their default values (for example, numbers to 0 and strings to null).\n",
    "Other Key Differences\n",
    "- No Inheritance: Structs cannot inherit from another struct or class.\n",
    "- Memory Allocation: Structs are usually stored on the stack, making them quicker to allocate and deallocate. However, if a struct is captured by a closure or stored in an array, it's stored on the heap. An array of structs is stored in a contiguous block of memory, which can improve performance due to locality of reference."
