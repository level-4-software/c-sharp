    "# More about Interfaces - IComparable\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Interfaces are used to establish contracts through which objects can interact with each other without knowing the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces are defined by using the interface keyword. An interface definition consists of a set of signatures for methods, properties, delegates, events, or indexers. An interface definition cannot consist of any data fields or any implementation details such as method bodies. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common interface defined in the System namespace is the IComparable namespace. This is a simple interface defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "interface IComparable\n",
    "{\n",
    "   int CompareTo(object obj);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The IComparable interface has a single method (CompareTo) that accepts an object and returns an int. The return value of this method indicates the result of comparing the given parameter with the current object. According to the documentation of the CompareTo method:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the instance is equal to the parameter, CompareTo returns 0. \n",
    "If the parameter value is less than the instance or if the parameter is null, then a positive value is returned.\n",
    "If the parameter value is greater than the instance, then a negative value is returned. \n",
    "If the parameter is not of the compatible type, then an ArgumentException is thrown.\n",
    "How does IComparable decide how to compare two Rectangle objects or two Employee objects? It doesn’t. The classes that are interested in such comparisons must implement the IComparable interface by providing a method body for the CompareTo method. Each class that implements IComparable is free to provide its own custom comparison logic inside the CompareTo method.\n",
    "\n",
    ">To integrate IComparable into the Animal class structure, let's assume we want to compare animals based on a new property, such as Name, since comparing based on >the animalSound method wouldn't be practical. This approach requires adding a Name property to the Animal class and implementing the IComparable interface to allow comparison \n",
    ">(and thereby sorting) of Animal objects based on their names.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Here's how you can modify your class structure to include IComparable along with extensive comments:"
