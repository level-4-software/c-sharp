    "# Aggregation and Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation and composition are not types of classes themselves but rather ways to design relationships between classes in object-oriented programming (OOP). These design principles dictate how objects interact and are associated with each other, contrasting with the concept of a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects. Let's clarify these concepts further and distinguish them from classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition: A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines a set of properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have.\n",
    "- Purpose: The primary purpose of a class is to encapsulate data and behavior that are related. It serves as the foundation for object creation and interaction in OOP.\n",
    "- Example: A Dog class might define properties like name, breed, and age, along with methods like bark() or eat().\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationship: Aggregation represents a \"has-a\" relationship but allows the contained object to exist independently of the container object.\n",
    "- Lifetime: The lifetime of the aggregated objects is not managed by the aggregator; they can live beyond the lifespan of the container.\n",
    "- Example: A School class might aggregate Teacher objects. Teachers can exist without the school, reflecting the independence of their lifetimes."

    "- Relationship: Composition also represents a \"has-a\" relationship but with a stronger linkage. The composed objects cannot exist independently of the container object.\n",
    "- Lifetime: The lifetime of the composed objects is strictly tied to the lifetime of the container. If the container object is destroyed, the composed objects are also destroyed.\n",
    "- Example: A Car class  is composed of various parts, like an engine, wheels, and a steering wheel. These parts, while they can be identified as separate objects and come from different classes (Engine, Wheel, SteeringWheel), do not exist independently of the car. If the car is scrapped, its components are considered scrapped too, even if they're physically intact. The car (the container) owns these components (the contained objects), and their lifecycles are tightly coupled."

    "### How They Differ from Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scope and Purpose: Classes are the basic building blocks in OOP that define the structure and behavior of objects. Aggregation and composition, on the other hand, describe how instances of these classes (objects) are related and interact with each other in a larger system.\n",
    "- Lifetime and Independence: While classes are concerned with the creation of objects, aggregation, and composition are concerned with the relationships between objects, especially how the lifetimes of related objects are managed.\n",
    "- Design Consideration: Classes focus on encapsulating data and behaviors. Aggregation and composition are high-level design considerations that focus on how objects of these classes form a coherent application or system, emphasizing the importance of understanding object lifecycles and dependencies.\n",
    "Understanding the distinction between these concepts is crucial for effective OOP design, allowing developers to create systems that are modular, maintainable, and understandable.\n"
