    "# Understanding Constructors with the Car Class Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a new car. Before you can start building, you need to decide on its make (like Toyota), model (like Camry), and colour (like red). In programming, especially in an object-oriented language like C#, this setup process can be efficiently handled using a constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Car Class Re-examined\n",
    "\n",
    "The Car class is like a blueprint for creating car objects. It defines what information you need to know about a car (its make, model, and colour) and what actions you can perform with it (like displaying its info or starting the car).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public Car(string make, string model, string colour)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    this.make = make;\n",
    "    this.model = model;\n",
    "    this.colour = colour;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is the constructor of the Car class. It looks like a method but notice it has the same name as the class and no return type.\n",
    "- When you create a new car object, you must provide these three pieces of information (make, model, colour)\n",
    "- The keyword `this` helps distinguish between the class's fields (like `this.make`) and the constructor's parameters (like `make`). It ensures the correct assignment of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would now use the constructor to create the `Car` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Car myCar = new Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", \"Red\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line tells the computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make a new Car object.\n",
    "- Use \"Toyota\" as the make, \"Camry\" as the model, and \"Red\" as the colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember we have methods associated with the `Car` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "We can not interact with the methods based upon the dot(.) notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "myCar.DisplayInfo(); // Outputs: This car is a Red Toyota Camry\n",
    "myCar.startCar(); // Outputs: The Toyota Camry is starting\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Construictors are great!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a constructor ensures every car object is properly set up with a make, model, and colour from the moment it's created. This way, you don't have to set each property individually and can avoid mistakes like forgetting to set the colour of a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, constructors in programming are like setting up your toy car before play: you decide on the essentials (make, model, colour) right at the start, ensuring it's ready to go as soon as you want to \"drive\" it in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Car Class Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "public class Car\n",
    "{\n",
    "    private string make;\n",
    "    private string model;\n",
    "    private string colour;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Car(string make, string model, string colour)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        this.make = make;\n",
    "        this.model = model;\n",
    "        this.colour = colour;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public void DisplayInfo()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            Console.WriteLine($\"This car is a {colour} {make} {model}\");\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public void startCar()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            Console.WriteLine($\"The {make} {model} is starting\");\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
