    "# OOP Problem: Library Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A local library needs a new system to manage its books, patrons (people who borrow books), and the borrowing process. The library offers books across various genres, and each book can be borrowed by a patron for a set period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Track Books and Patrons:**\n",
    "   - The system must keep track of all the books available in the library and the patrons who are registered to borrow books.\n",
    "2. **Borrowing Process:**\n",
    "   - It should allow patrons to borrow and return books.\n",
    "3. **Overdue Tracking:**\n",
    "   - The system must monitor overdue books and notify patrons of their overdue status.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Book:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Title, Author, Genre, ISBN, Borrowed (Boolean), BorrowedBy (Patron), DueDate\n",
    "  - Methods: BorrowBook(Patron, Date), ReturnBook()\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Patron:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Name, LibraryCardNumber, CurrentBorrowedBooks (List of Books)\n",
    "  - Methods: BorrowBook(Book), ReturnBook(Book), CheckOverdueBooks()\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Library:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Catalog (List of Books), Patrons (List of Patrons)\n",
    "  - Methods: AddBook(Book), RegisterPatron(Patron), RemoveBook(Book), FindBookByTitle(Title), FindPatronByName(Name)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use OOP principles like encapsulation to hide the inner workings of the classes and expose only necessary information and actions.\n",
    "- Implement inheritance or interfaces if there are shared behaviors or attributes among the classes to promote code reuse.\n",
    "- Consider using design patterns where applicable, for example, a Singleton pattern for the Library class to ensure only one instance exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing this system will help the library manage its operations more efficiently, keep better track of its books and patrons, and improve the borrowing process.\n"
