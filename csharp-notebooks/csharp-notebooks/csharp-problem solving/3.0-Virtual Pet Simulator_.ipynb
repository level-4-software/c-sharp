    "# OOP Problem: Virtual Pet Simulation Game\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a virtual pet simulation game where players can adopt and take care of virtual pets. The game should simulate various aspects of pet care, such as feeding, playing, and grooming, and allow players to interact with their pets to build a bond and maintain their well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pet Adoption:**\n",
    "   - Players should be able to adopt virtual pets of different species, each with unique characteristics and needs.\n",
    "2. **Pet Care:**\n",
    "   - Implement mechanics for feeding, playing with, grooming, and providing medical care for pets.\n",
    "3. **Interactivity:**\n",
    "   - Allow players to interact with their pets through various activities and observe their pets' reactions.\n",
    "4. **Well-being Management:**\n",
    "   - Track the well-being of pets and adjust their care routine accordingly to ensure they remain happy and healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pet:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Species, Name, HungerLevel, HappinessLevel, CleanlinessLevel, HealthStatus.\n",
    "  - Methods: Feed(), Play(), Groom(), Heal(), CheckStatus().\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Player:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Name, Pets (List of Pets).\n",
    "  - Methods: AdoptPet(Pet), InteractWithPet(Pet), CheckPetStatus(Pet).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design a variety of pet species with different needs and behaviours to provide diversity and replayability.\n",
    "- Implement a dynamic environment where pets' needs change over time, requiring ongoing care and attention from players.\n",
    "- Include visual and audio feedback to enhance player engagement and immersion in the virtual pet experience.\n",
    "- Consider incorporating gamification elements such as achievements, rewards, and progression systems to motivate players and keep them engaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating this virtual pet simulation game will offer players an immersive and enjoyable experience, allowing them to bond with their virtual pets and experience the joys and responsibilities of pet ownership in a virtual setting.\n",
