    "## Starter Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Classes:** Create classes for `Pet` and `Player` based on the suggested attributes and methods provided in the problem statement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Implement Class Methods:** Write the methods within each class to simulate pet care activities and player interactions with their pets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pet Class\n",
    "- Define attributes: `Species`, `Name`, `HungerLevel`, `HappinessLevel`, `CleanlinessLevel`, `HealthStatus`.\n",
    "- Implement methods: `Feed()`, `Play()`, `Groom()`, `Heal()`, `CheckStatus()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Player Class\n",
    "- Define attributes: `Name`, `Pets`.\n",
    "- Implement methods: `AdoptPet(Pet)`, `InteractWithPet(Pet)`, `CheckPetStatus(Pet)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation Logic:** Design realistic simulation mechanics to simulate pet behaviour and needs over time, providing a dynamic and engaging experience for players.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **User Interface:** Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface to allow players to interact with their pets and manage their care effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement visual and audio feedback to provide immediate feedback to players' actions and reinforce positive behaviours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game Testing:** Test the game extensively to ensure all pet care mechanics work as intended and provide an enjoyable player experience.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Player Feedback:** Gather feedback from players to identify areas for improvement and prioritize feature enhancements accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Comments:** Include clear and concise comments throughout your code to explain complex logic or functionality.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **User Manual:** Provide a comprehensive user manual or tutorial to help players understand how to play the game and care for their virtual pets effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration and Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Community Engagement:** Foster a community around the game to encourage player interaction, sharing of experiences, and feedback.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly update the game based on player feedback and emerging trends to keep it fresh and engaging for players.\n"
