    "## Starter Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Classes:** Create classes for `Product`, `Customer`, and `Order` based on the suggested attributes and methods provided in the problem statement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Implement Class Methods:** Write the methods within each class to perform actions such as adding products to the shopping cart, placing orders, and managing order status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Product Class\n",
    "- Define attributes: `Name`, `Description`, `Price`, `Category`, `QuantityAvailable`.\n",
    "- Implement methods: `UpdateQuantityAvailable()`, `GetProductDetails()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Customer Class\n",
    "- Define attributes: `Name`, `Email`, `Address`, `ShoppingCart`.\n",
    "- Implement methods: `Register()`, `Login()`, `AddToCart(Product)`, `RemoveFromCart(Product)`, `Checkout()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Order Class\n",
    "- Define attributes: `Customer`, `Products`, `TotalPrice`, `OrderStatus`.\n",
    "- Implement methods: `CalculateTotalPrice()`, `PlaceOrder()`, `CancelOrder()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:** Ensure that each class encapsulates its data and functionality appropriately. Hide internal data and expose only necessary methods to interact with that data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and edge cases gracefully, providing a seamless user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Authentication:** Implement secure authentication mechanisms for customer registration and login to protect user data and ensure privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit Testing:** Test each class and its methods individually to ensure they work as expected.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between different classes to verify the overall functionality of the online shopping system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and prioritize feature enhancements accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Comments:** Include clear and concise comments throughout your code to explain complex logic or functionality.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **API Documentation:** Document the public interface of your classes and methods to help other developers understand how to use your online shopping system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration and Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reviews:** Collaborate with team members through code reviews to improve code quality and ensure adherence to coding standards.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **User Testing:** Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback and identify usability issues or pain points in the online shopping experience.\n"
