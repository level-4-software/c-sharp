    "# OOP Problem: Online Shopping System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "An online shopping platform needs a system to manage its products, customers, and orders. The platform offers a wide range of products across different categories, and customers can place orders for products they wish to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Product Management:**\n",
    "   - The system must maintain a catalog of products available for purchase.\n",
    "2. **Customer Management:**\n",
    "   - It should manage customer accounts, including registration and login.\n",
    "3. **Order Processing:**\n",
    "   - Facilitate the process of placing orders, including adding items to a shopping cart and completing transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Name, Description, Price, Category, QuantityAvailable.\n",
    "  - Methods: UpdateQuantityAvailable(), GetProductDetails().\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Name, Email, Address, ShoppingCart (List of Products).\n",
    "  - Methods: Register(), Login(), AddToCart(Product), RemoveFromCart(Product), Checkout().\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Customer, Products (List of Products), TotalPrice, OrderStatus.\n",
    "  - Methods: CalculateTotalPrice(), PlaceOrder(), CancelOrder().\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to design flexible and maintainable classes.\n",
    "- Implement authentication mechanisms for customer login and registration.\n",
    "- Ensure data validation and error handling to maintain data integrity and provide a seamless user experience.\n",
    "- Consider implementing design patterns like the Factory pattern for creating product objects or the Observer pattern for tracking order status changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing this system will streamline the online shopping experience for customers and improve the management of products and orders for the platform.\n",
    "\n"
