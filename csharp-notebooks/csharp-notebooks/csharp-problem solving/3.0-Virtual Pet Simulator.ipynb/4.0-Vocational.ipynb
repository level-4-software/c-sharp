    "# OOP Problem: Military Technology Development System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A company specializing in military technology development requires a system to manage its projects, resources, and collaborations effectively. The system should facilitate the design, development, testing, and deployment of advanced military technologies to meet the evolving needs of the armed forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Project Management:**\n",
    "   - Manage projects from inception to completion, including planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.\n",
    "2. **Resource Allocation:**\n",
    "   - Allocate personnel, equipment, and budget resources to projects based on their requirements and priorities.\n",
    "3. **Collaboration Management:**\n",
    "   - Facilitate collaboration with external partners, subcontractors, and government agencies involved in technology development projects.\n",
    "4. **Technology Development:**\n",
    "   - Support the design, development, testing, and refinement of cutting-edge military technologies, including weapons systems, communication systems, and surveillance equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Name, Description, StartDate, EndDate, Budget, Status, Team (List of Personnel).\n",
    "  - Methods: AddTeamMember(Personnel), RemoveTeamMember(Personnel), UpdateStatus(Status), AllocateBudget(), ScheduleTasks(), ReviewProgress().\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ResourceAllocationSystem:**\n",
    "  - Attributes: Personnel, Equipment, Budget.\n",
    "  - Methods: AllocatePersonnel(Project), AllocateEquipment(Project), AllocateBudget(Project).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design a user-friendly interface for project managers to monitor project progress, allocate resources, and communicate with team members and stakeholders.\n",
    "- Implement version control and documentation management systems to track changes and revisions to project plans, designs, and specifications.\n",
    "- Utilize project management methodologies such as Agile or Scrum to ensure iterative and adaptive development of military technologies.\n",
    "- Foster a culture of innovation and collaboration within the company to drive technological advancements and maintain a competitive edge in the defence industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing this military technology development system will enable the company to streamline its project management processes, optimize resource utilization, and accelerate the delivery of innovative military technologies to enhance national security and defence capabilities.\n",
