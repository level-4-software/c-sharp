    "## Starter Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Classes:** Create classes for `Project` and `ResourceAllocationSystem` based on the suggested attributes and methods provided in the problem statement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Implement Class Methods:** Write the methods within each class to handle project management tasks such as resource allocation, budget tracking, and progress monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Class\n",
    "- Define attributes: `Name`, `Description`, `StartDate`, `EndDate`, `Budget`, `Status`, `Team`.\n",
    "- Implement methods: `AddTeamMember(Personnel)`, `RemoveTeamMember(Personnel)`, `UpdateStatus(Status)`, `AllocateBudget()`, `ScheduleTasks()`, `ReviewProgress()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ResourceAllocationSystem Class\n",
    "- Define attributes: `Personnel`, `Equipment`, `Budget`.\n",
    "- Implement methods: `AllocatePersonnel(Project)`, `AllocateEquipment(Project)`, `AllocateBudget(Project)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Interface Design:** Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface to facilitate project management tasks and enhance user experience.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Integration with External Systems:** Integrate the system with external tools and platforms for version control, documentation management, and communication to streamline workflows and enhance collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Improvement:** Encourage feedback from project managers and team members to identify areas for improvement and iteratively enhance the system over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Acceptance Testing:** Conduct user acceptance testing with project managers and team members to ensure the system meets their requirements and expectations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Iterative Development:** Adopt an iterative development approach to incrementally improve the system based on user feedback and evolving business needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Manuals:** Provide comprehensive user manuals and documentation to help users understand how to use the system effectively.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Technical Documentation:** Document the system architecture, design decisions, and implementation details for future reference and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration and Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Engage with project managers, team members, and stakeholders to gather feedback and ensure the system meets their needs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Ongoing Support:** Provide ongoing support and training to users to help them make the most of the system and address any issues or concerns.\n"
